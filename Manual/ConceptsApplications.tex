\section{Introduction}
% --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Whereas the previous chapters handled the basic modules and a
comparison of their results with psychoacoustic data, this chapter
focuses on some more elaborated applications where these modules
are used in practice. Each of the sections in this chapter
contains:
\begin{itemize}
\item a small introduction in which the purpose of the application is explained
\item a description of the method that is used
\item a summary of how to run the application in practice using
the toolbox and its functions
\item an overview of the obtained results and a discussion thereof
\end{itemize}
The applications are explained from a practical viewpoint, and
each time a link is made between the related concepts and the
practical tools (MATLAB functions) available in the toolbox.\\

The following applications are included:
\begin{itemize}
\item Roughness applications: relationships between timbre, scales and roughness.
\item A rhythmic pattern extraction demonstration for extracting
repetitive rhythm patterns from a sound fragment.
\end{itemize}
Each application can be seen as a demonstration of one (or more)
module(s) that were handled in the first chapter. You can of
course freely experiment with the modules yourself and build some
new applications from the basic functions. If you think that
you've come up with something interesting, we would love to hear
about it!
