The "\IPEMShortTitle, \IPEMFullTitle" is a toolbox for MATLAB
developed by the IPEM as part of a research methodology in the
domain of musical content extraction.\\ It contains functions for
characterizing and examining features present in acoustical
signals and prerecorded musical sounds (audio signals).\\

The \IPEMShortTitle can be useful for researchers who are
interested in musical content analysis and automatic extraction
and
description of musical features.\\
It is our aim to provide these people with functionality for
dealing with different aspects of feature extraction in the field
of music perception such as: chords and tonality, pitch,
roughness, onset detection, beat and meter extraction, timbre
characteristics.\\

Some of the functions in this toolbox are general purpose signal
processing functions, whereas others are implementations of
specific algorithms developed by the IPEM.\\
They all obey the 'black box' principle: input $\rightarrow$
process $\rightarrow$ output, and they are kept as general as
possible (hence the sometimes great number of input arguments).
Scripts are only provided for demonstrating the use of some
functions.\\

Apart from a set of functions for general use, the toolbox will
also contain some functions which are written specifically for a
particular demo. You can find the entire list of functions in the
\hyperlink{Chapter:FuncRef}{Function Reference}.
