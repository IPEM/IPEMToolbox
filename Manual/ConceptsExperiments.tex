\IPEMTBC ...Doublecheck this...

Whereas the previous chapter provided a background and description
of the basic modules contained in the IPEM Toolbox, this chapter
focuses on a comparison of the results obtained with our tools
with these obtained from psychoacoustical experiments. Each of the
sections in this chapter contains:
\begin{itemize}
\item a small introduction in which the purpose of the experiment is explained
\item a description of the method that is used
\item a summary of how to run the experiment in practice using
the toolbox and its functions
\item an overview of the obtained results and a discussion thereof
\end{itemize}
The experiments are explained from a conceptual viewpoint, and
each time a link is made between these concepts and the practical
tools (MATLAB functions) available in the toolbox.\\

The following experiments are included:
\begin{itemize}
\item Simulations of roughness in comparison with psychoacoustical data.
\item Short-term model of tonal induction experiments which apply
contextuality to simulate two psychological experiments.
\end{itemize}
Each experiment can be seen as a comparison of one (or more)
module(s) that were handled in the previous chapter with data
obtained from experiments in the psychoacoustic research field.
