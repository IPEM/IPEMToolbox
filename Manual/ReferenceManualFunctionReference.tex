The following pages contain the entire list of functions that are
written for general use (and in future versions also the ones that
were written to setup a particular demo).

The information provided here is essentially the same as the one
you would get from typing
\IPEMCodeExtract{help} followed by the
function's name at the Matlab command prompt.\\

% Include automatically extracted reference file
